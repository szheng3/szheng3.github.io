        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
        and the date and time of each visitor request. Shuai's Resume's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Shuai's Resume's visitors use its website. From time to time, Shuai's
        Resume may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
        trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shuai's Resume also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
        addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://szheng3.github.io blog posts. Shuai's
        Resume
